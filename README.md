Makers Academy - Week 1. Project 1.
Boris Bikes

The first challenge of the course is to imagine we are Junior Developers, employed by 
Transport for London who are responsible for the delivery of a new bike system to plan a network of Docking Stations and bikes, that anyone can use for a small free. 

We have been tasked with building a program that will run all the docking stations, simulate all the bikes and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff etc) required to implement their vision.
