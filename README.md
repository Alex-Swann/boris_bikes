<h2>Boris Bikes</h2>

The first challenge of the course is to imagine we are Junior Developers, employed by Transport for London who are responsible for the delivery of a new bike system to plan a network of Docking Stations and bikes, that anyone can use for a small free.

We have been tasked with building a program that will run all the docking stations, simulate all the bikes and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff etc) required to implement their vision.
